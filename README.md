# What is this?

This application is built with the "Choose Your Own Adventure" decision making format. It is designed to explore the difficult choice company executives make with social media content moderation, and the different consequences that come from each decision. Users actually become the company executives and make their decisions, to promote dicussion surrounding the ethical responsibility social media platform executives hold. 

# Key Features
1. Users can select from multiple different scenarios, representing different environments and situations social media platforms, and executives, can find themselves in. 

2. Each scenario has its own sequential decisions specific to the scenario chosen on the first page. Each choice is associated with a positive, negative, or mixed consequence, represented by the background of the page (red for negative, blue for positive, and purple for mixed). The options are specific to each choice the user makes. 

3. While in reality, executive cannot exactly hit "back" or "refresh" and start over, this application allows users to go back and start over, through the back button and refresh buttons respectively, to allow a more effective understanding of the responsibility and consequences platforms must assume and deal with.
